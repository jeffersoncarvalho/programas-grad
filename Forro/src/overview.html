<i>Forró</i> is a framework for all simulations on distributed or heterogeneous
networks.

In recent years, computer simulations are becoming more 
important for the study and solution of a wide range of problems in science and engineering. 
Fast and accurate computer simulation of realistic three-dimensional models of 
processes is a valuable tool for engineers and scientists exploring the 
details of a given problem. Many of these systems use visualization techniques to 
help engineers to better interpret the simulation results and to make judicious 
modifications to the model in order to enhance the simulations' accuracy and efficiency.  
The advent of three-dimensional visualization and of the so-called ``CAVES'' brought these 
visualization capabilities to a high level of sophistication. However, more processing
power is required, because the simulation has to provide data to these 
visualization tools at greater speed, in order to perform visualizations
in "real-time".

Due to the size of problems, which may vary from $10^4$ up to $10^7$ 
degrees of freedom (number of the systems' unknowns) or, in some cases, even more, 
parallelism plays an important role in any realistic simulation and is present in most 
simulation systems. In such a system, the diferential equations associated with the problem 
cannot be solved analytically, requiring a numerical method in order
to obtain an approximate solution. The Finite Element Method is one of the 
most used numerical methods to address this problem, because of
its relative simplicity and generality. 
In this method, most of the computational time is spent on 
solving the linear system of equations associated with it. For this reason, the overall performance of the finite element analysis 
code is strongly influenced by the performance of the linear system solver used.
