This package contains interfaces, abstract and instantiable classes to  simulation sessions
with <i>Forró</i> on a distributed and heterogeneous network. 
<br><br>
A <i>simulation session</i> is composed by a <i>Front-End</i> and a set of
<i>Model Implementations</i>. The session's <i>Front-End</i> allows the user to interact with the
simulation session for data input, configuration, probing and introspection purposes. 
On the other hand, each <i>Model Implementation</i> 
is an object running on a specified <i>location</i> of the network.
<br><br>
Two main application-oriented interfaces are provided by this package. The first one consists of the 
<i>Tableau de Bord</i> interface. The second defines the <i>Model Implementations</i>. Indeed, it is 
derivated from a more general interface for remote objects, which is intended to allow a model 
implementation to invoke methods on remote objects of the simulation session.
<br><br>
The abstract classes in this package are skeletal implementations to minimize the effort to
implement the corresponding interfaces.
